# Yelp-Database-System

This project consists of an implementation of a Database from real-world data. We first cleaned the data using a Python notebook with Pandas and Regex libraries.
Then, we proceeded to Data Definition in SQL.
Finally, we implemented sample SQL queries to show that our database was queriable and yielding the corrects results. We also optimized for better performance.
